In the .droidconKE app we are using the following Firebase SDKs
1. Cloud Firestore
2. Cloud Messaging
3. Crashlytics
4. Cloud Functions
5. Authentication
6. Cloud Storage
7. Remote Config

For those who want to run the code for the .droidconKE app, follow the setup steps below for each of the Firebase SDKs as outlined below.

### Authentication Setup

The .droidconKE uses Google sign up for users to easily sign up/in to the app. Firebase has a couple of authentication methods but are only using Google Sign in. In your Firebase Console, Go to Authentication and click on the **Sign-in method tab and enable Google.**


### Cloud Storage Setup
All the images for the .droidconKE app are stored in Cloud Storage. The images are grouped into folders for easier identification. The following are the folders in the cloud storage.

**1. agenda_icons/** - This contains icons for the conference agenda. Example of the agendas include lunch, after hours, codelabs etc. You can have your own icons and place them in these folder and add their names as:
   1. codelabs.png
   2. lunch.png
   3. afterhours.png
   4. etc
   
**2. designs/** - This folder contains the designs for the conference.Example images in this folder are:
   1. hack_bounty.png
   2. sponsor_slots.png
   3. pitching.png
 
**3. organizers/** - This folder contains the logos for the organizers of the conference. Example images in this folder are:
   1. organizer_one.jpeg
   2. organizer_two.png
   
**4. sessions/** - This folder contains the designs for each session of the conference. Example images in this folder are:
   1. jetpack_compose.png
   2. compassionate_android_developer.png
   
**5. speakers/** - This folder contains the profile pictures for the various speakers at the conference . Example images in this folder are:
   1. speaker_one.png
   2. speaker_two.png
   
**6. sponsors/** - This folder contains the logos for the companies that sponsor the conference. Example images in this folder are: 
   1. sponsor_one.png
   2. sponsor_two.png
   
  The images can either be **.png/jpeg/jpg**. You can add as many folders as need be.
  
### Cloud Functions
  
Cloud Functions are for listening when a user "stars" or favourites a session. When a favourited session is about to begin, the cloud functions will trigger cloud messaging to send notifications to all users who have starred/favourited the session. The code for the cloud functions can be found [here](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE/blob/master/functions/index.js)

### Cloud Messaging

For Cloud Mesaging, no additional configurations are needed. The default console settings are good to go with.

### Crashlytics

The Crashlytics setup has already been done in gradle files according to the following [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started). 

### Remote Config

We depend on Remote Config for the data which can change during the conference and the data that is required to change  quickly and reflect to the users upon change. The remote config defaults can be found in [this](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/remote_config_defaults.xml) file. Add the parameters according to their `key` in the file in the Remote Config section of Firebase Console.

  ### NOTE
  ```
  * Make sure all field names in cloud firestore are as in the Cloud firestore section to avoid exceptions in the app.
  * Ensure that the type of the field is maintained
  * The Cloud Firestore data model tends to follow a kind of relational database to avoid repetition of data . This however does not mean that this is the go-to approach, You can come up with a more efficient data model structure a feel free to open a Pull Request. We always Love  a Pull Request
  * The data model structure can be changed depending on your use case
